DESCRIPTION
    Generates a DBIx::Class::ResultSource from a YAML description. If the
    YAML is presented as shown in the SYNOPSIS the ResultSource class will
    be self POD documenting. If the class is executed with 'configuration'
    in @ARGV, a summary of the ResultSource is printed to standard out.

GOTCHA
    Note that relationships sometimes need to be created in a particular
    order (such is the case when defining many_to_many relationships). Given
    that, the relationships key takes an array of hashes; watch the
    indentation carefully (it's correct above). It'd be possible to
    optionally allow a hash here, but I think that might lead to hard to
    find errors. Drop me a line if you have a strong opinion.

RATIONALE
    The "self-documenting" bit mentioned above. Also, there's a boatload of
    punctuation and quoting that is required to do this the usual way; it's
    less error prone, in my opinion, to use YAML as good text editors will
    do the right thing by it.
